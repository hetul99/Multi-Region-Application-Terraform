# Deploying to AWS with Terraform and Ansible Repo

This course was originally created before Terrafom 0.13 was released however I have updated it to work with version 0.13 in the `terraform_v13_compatible_code` folder.


------

We are using Terraform 0.12 refer to the `aws_multiple_workers_version`.

Again, for using Terraform 0.13 refer to the `terraform_v13_compatible_code`.

## Warning
1. Parts of this repository expect users to obtain a Route53 domain name
2. Following along and deploying resources in AWS as taught by this course WILL incur charges!!! Be sure to destroy any infrastructure that you do not need.
